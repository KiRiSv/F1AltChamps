# F1AltChamp

F1AltChamp is a website that explores the possible outcomes of F1 championships throughout history if they had taken place with different scoring rules.

You can select one of the preset point distributions or enter your own custom one.

This project was made by Anna Zhou and Kim Rikter-Svendsen. 

You can see the product on [our website](https://f1.zoeyzhou.net).

# Limitations
* Ties are broken alphabetically.
* Sprint races are not included.
* Full points are given regardless of amount of race laps completed
